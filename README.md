**What does it do?**
1. Scrape the top n posts on user-defined subreddits on Reddit.com.
2. Get the top n comments of the top posts.
3. Convert the comments into audio. Character limit only applied so that it doesn't break the bank.

**To Dos**

4. [Todo] Generate AI video for the audio so that you can use this all-in-one system for Youtube Shorts or TikTok.

After successfully getting my app to work live (steps 1 to 3) on https://reddit-text-to-speech.onrender.com, my audio access was disabled by ElevenLabs since it is on the Free Tier. Guess I have to get on the Paid plan to return to this project:
