**What does it do?**

1. Scrape the top n posts on user-defined subreddits on Reddit.com.
2. Get the top n comments within those top posts.
3. Convert the post titles and the top n comments that follow into audio. Character limiter applied so that it doesn't break the bank.

**To Dos**

4. Overlay/Generate AI video for the audio so that the output is a completed video that is ready to be uploaded for Youtube Shorts or TikTok.

After successfully getting my app to work live (steps 1 to 3) on Render, my audio access was disabled by ElevenLabs since it is on the Free Tier. Guess I'd have to get on the Paid plan to return to this project:
