I was walking out of the gas station with a buddy one day, grabbed a jug of washer fluid, and he asked me “did you just steal that?” And I was like “No dude it’s free”. It’s not, I stole washer fluid for nearly ten years of driving and no one ever said anything to me about it. 2. How the American bail system works. \\n\\nI thought it was a sum of money you paid to avoid jail. I was surprised when I realized you get the money BACK if you show up for your trial. 3. Not me, but my 21yo cousin just realized he is mildly allergic to peanut butter, and has been his whole life.\\n\\nUp until now, he had assumed EVERYONE\\'S throat closed up a little while eating a pb&j sandwich, but they just fought through it. 4. Water towers are for water pressure, not just a town putting its name on a tank and saying \" Hey look how much dang water WE have.\" 5. There is a local plumbing company call “Abacus” with a tag line “you can count on us”. After 20 years I realized their logo was an abacus. 6. That the best time to start saving for my future really was all those years ago. 7. When I was 15 I realized rice isn’t pasta chopped in small pieces 8. When I was a 20 something regular cannabis user struggling to clean my pipe, only then realizing thats what pipe cleaners were for. Those fuzzy bendable tubes weren\\'t just for childhood crafts. 9. That it’s called metal because it’s harder than rock (music). 10. In the song ‘I saw mommy kissing Santa Clause’ it’s the husband dressed up as Santa and kissing his wife. Mommy is not having an affair with Santa. '"
